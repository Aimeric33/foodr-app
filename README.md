# ðŸ“š Swip'eat web app

Swip'eat is a Tinder-like app for food lovers who wants to discover new meals around them with a fun user experience. You can easily swipe photos of meals, keep them in your favorites list and book a table in the restaurant to taste it. We wanted to focus on showing the meals instead of the restaurants like others booking app do (TheFork, TripAdvisor...).  

This app has been developed during Le Wagon's Bootcamp in the last two weeks by a team of 4 developers including me. We pitched it during the DemoDay (last day of the bootcamp) in front of external people. 

Here are some screenshots:
